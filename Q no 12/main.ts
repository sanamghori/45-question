/*Question no 12
Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, 
but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a 
message to them. The text of each message should be the same, 
but each message should be personalized
 with the person’s name.*/

 //let names: string[] = ["adil", "ramish", "moiz"];
 //console.log("Hello " + names[0] + ", how are you?");
 //console.log("Hello " + names[1] + ", how are you?");
 //console.log("Hello " + names[2] + ", how are you?");
