Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. 
The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name.
 It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. 
 Call the function with the required information and two other 
 name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print 
 the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.*/
